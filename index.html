        <h1>HI, I'm <span>Taha</span></h1>
        <p>I’m a third-year Bachelor of Arts student in Information Technology with a strong passion for cybersecurity and cloud engineering.I enjoy exploring topics like network defense, threat detection, and building secure cloud-based infrastructures.My interest in cybersecurity stems from a desire to protect data and systems in an increasingly connected world.</p>
        <p>I’ve developed practical skills in cloud platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, working with services like virtual machines, storage, and identity management.I also have experience in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and backend programming in Java.I’m eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and continue learning in both security and cloud fields.</p>
